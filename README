Evolution codes for EdGB gravity in spherical symmetry.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For help please contact jripley AT princeton.edu. 

The code ouputs to ``sdf`` files, using routines imported from the
``bbhutil`` library; see 
http://laplace.physics.ubc.ca/Group/Software.html
for more information.
See also src/io_sdf.cpp 

This setup files (``setup.py`` and ``sim_class.py``)
are configured to run on the Feynman cluster at Princeton University.
They write and run a slurm script
(see https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html),
which launches the ``run`` binary (see the ``Makefile``).
The ``run`` binary also can be run on a personal computer.
