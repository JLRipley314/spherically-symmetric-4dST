# Evolution codes for 4dST gravity in spherical symmetry.

Codes to run 4dST gravity models in spherical symmetry.
For more details on the theory this solves for, and details of the numerical
implementation, see the documentation.

## Visualization

I use pyqtgraph-graph derived software
(see [here](https://github.com/JLRipley314/sci-vis))
to visualize the output data (radial field values as a function of time),
which are saved as csv files.
